Watched Grading Homework Summaries - seen, will provide structured homework notes
Watched Week 1 - Live Streamed Video - watched the whole video and followed through. learned a ton about docker, part about architecture and how it interacts with the host OS was my favourite part
Remember to Commit Your Code - turned out I was committing to another branch and had some conflicts. resolved them and learned what to avoid
Watcked Chirag's Week 1 - Spending Considerations - gitpod usage should be enough but i'll move to codespaces if needed
Watched Ashish's Week 1 - Container Security Considerations - interesting lecture, i was afraid that there would be very specific and in-depth containerization security controls, but it turned out to be less so, since a lot depends on the host OS. Image security, container configs, updates and networking seem to be the biggest considerations
Containerize Application (Dockerfiles, Docker Compose) - followed along, pretty successfuly. recently had some experience with docker, so it was great to solidify knowledge
Document the Notification Endpoint for the OpenAI Document
Write a Flask Backend Endpoint for Notifications, Write a React Page for Notifications - enjoyed following through here. Didn't understand indepth what was happening, but this wasnt the point of the bootcamp, so I'm not worried. Did learn some things about APIs.	
Run DynamoDB Local Container and ensure it works - followed along here, got everything running. built upon our knowledge on docker and using it to host the DB.
Run Postgres Container and ensure it works -  it was nice to see the troubleshooting process that we had to go through. Had a silly mistake here, not chaning the tab of DB explorer to postgres, but luckily i found out. 


overall very productive week, I'm very happy with the container security considerations and the work with docker.
